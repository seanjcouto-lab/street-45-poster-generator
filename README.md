## What this enforces

- Fixed left-to-right band geometry
- Locked depth planes (front / mid)
- Lighting hierarchy with intentional suppression
- No visual rebalancing for symmetry
- Atmosphere applied only after structural accuracy

This generator prioritizes constraint fidelity over visual optimization.
